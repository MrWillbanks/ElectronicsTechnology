**ElectronicsTechnology GitHub Repository for managing common Electronics Technology Documents**

General rules:
  1. Sign up with your cttech email
  2. Make your username your name, so I can easily tell who is changing what.

When updating documents:
  1. Create a new branch *with a relevant name*
  2. "Commit" your work periodically on your branch as you update it
  3. When you're ready to submit your work, create a "pull-request." ***Do not confirm the pull request.*** Submit the request & I will count that as submitting your assignment. From that point, I will review & approve your request after grading your work.
