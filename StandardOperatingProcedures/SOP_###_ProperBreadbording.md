5.	Procedure
  	
| Step | Procedure | Picture |
|-|-|-|
|1. | A breadboard has 2 sides, each with 4 vertical rails that separate in the middle and many horizontal rails. These rails transfer power through them to all the holes in the rail. | <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/main/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/ProperBreadbarding/IMG_20240308_104532.jpg" width="81"/> <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/main/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/ProperBreadbarding/IMG_20240308_104538.jpg" width="81"/> |
| 2. | Wires can be used to redirect where power goes on your breadboard without impacting your circuit. When using wires you want to keep them as short as possible and neat. You also want to color code your wires with red positive, black negative, and a different color for wires in the middle. | <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/main/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/ProperBreadbarding/IMG_20240308_104543.jpg" width="200"/> <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/main/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/ProperBreadbarding/IMG_20240308_104545.jpg" width="200"/> |
| 3.| When putting components into a breadboard you want to keep them straight and orderly, this will help with organization and identifying issues if they occur. | <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/main/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/ProperBreadbarding/IMG_20240308_104542.jpg" width="200"/> <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/main/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/ProperBreadbarding/IMG_20240308_104544.jpg" width="200"/> |
| 4. | When placing a chip in a breadboard you want to make sure it is centered between two sides of the breadboard and both sides have their pins connected. If you put the pins on either side of the chip in the same horizontal row the chip will not work and could break. | <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/main/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/ProperBreadbarding/IMG_20240308_104540.jpg" width="200"/> <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/main/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/ProperBreadbarding/IMG_20240308_104536.jpg" width="200"/> |
