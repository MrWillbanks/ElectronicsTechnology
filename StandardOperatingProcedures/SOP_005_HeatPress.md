3.	 Purpose: 
2.1.	 To transfer blue sheet ink to the copper boards.

4.	Safety: While the heat press is on donâ€™t touch it, as it gets extremely hot.
3.1.	 It also holds on to heat very well so you might need to let it cool down before you grab your board.

5.	Materials:
1.	Copper board 
2.	Printed Bluesheet
3.	Heat Press
4.	Putty knife or similar object 





6.	Procedure:

   
| Step  	|Procedure:|  Pictures: |
|-|-|-|
|1.|  Acquire a printed bluesheet and cut out your circuit. Acquire a copper board and cut it out to a size that is slightly bigger than your bluesheet, if possible, find a board that doesn't need to be cut.   | <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/SOP_005_Heat-Press/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/heatpress/SOP_005_Step-1.jpg?raw=true" alt="Image" width="200"/>|
|2.|	Place the circuit on the copper board, shiny side up.  | <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/SOP_005_Heat-Press/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/heatpress/SOP_005_Step-2.jpg?raw=true" alt="image" width="200"/>|
|3.|	 Pre-heat the heat press to 325 degrees fahrenheit. The pressure is already set, no need for adjustment. | <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/SOP_005_Heat-Press/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/heatpress/SOP_005_Step-3.jpg?raw=true" alt="image" width="200"/>|
|4.|	 Place the board and sheet on the heat press with the bluesheet facing up. Place it as close to the center as possible. Be careful not to touch the inside of the heat press while doing so. | <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/SOP_005_Heat-Press/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/heatpress/SOP_005_Step-4.jpg?raw=true" alt="image" width="200"/>|
|5.|	 Press the board for about 3 minutes. | <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/SOP_005_Heat-Press/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/heatpress/SOP_005_Step-5.jpg?raw=true" alt="image" width="200"/>|
|6.|	Carefully remove the board from the heat press, ideally with a putty knife or something similar, if one is not available, use your nail to drag it off. Beware that the copper will be very hot.    | <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/SOP_005_Heat-Press/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/heatpress/SOP_005_Step-6.png?raw=true" alt="image" width="200"/>|   
|7.|	Check the board, if the paper is still easily peeling from the copper, put it back on the heat press for another 30 seconds. Repeat from step 6 as necessary until the bluesheet sticks to the copper board. Iit is sticking, let it sit for a few minutes to cool before removing it, remember to turn off the heat press as well.  | <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/SOP_005_Heat-Press/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/heatpress/SOP_005_Step-7.jpg?raw=true" alt="image" width="200"/>|
|8.|	 Rinse board in clean, cold water.  | <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/SOP_005_Heat-Press/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/heatpress/SOP_005_Step-8.jpg?raw=true" alt="image" width="200"/>|
|9.|	Remove and dispose of the excess film from the board.   | <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/SOP_005_Heat-Press/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/heatpress/SOP_005_Step-9.jpg?raw=true" alt="image" width="200"/>|
