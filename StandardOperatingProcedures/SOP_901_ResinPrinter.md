 Because it is new to the shop and no one knows how to use it yet.

When using a resin printer, crack open the window near the printer and shut all blinds. Wear gloves to not get resin on it.

4. For Resin Printer
Leave print out to dry when it is done
Wear gloves when touching any part of the resin including adding resin or taking out resin of the resin printer.
Put in a bin of isopropyl alcohol to dissolve any excess resin that shouldn’t be on the print.
Use a toothbrush or wipes to clean off anything the isopropyl alcohol didn’t take off.
Then do the same thing to the printing plate
If there's extra resin pour back in through a filter to catch any lumps or clumps
