Visiual Controls: <br>

| Control | Description | Picture |
|-|-|-|
|Illum | Adjusts the amount of extra light for display (most likely won't need to use it ever) | |
|Focus | Adjusts the focus of the graph (for when it seems blurry) | |
|Inten| Adjusts the intensity of the graph (for when the graph seems dim) | | <br>

Vertical Controls: <br>

| Control | Description | Picture |
|-|-|-|
|Position |Moves the graph up and down | |
|Variable Volts/Div |Changes the y-scale (volts per division) | |
|CH1/CH2 |Turns on/off the channel | |
|AC/DC|Changes what the graph is reading (AC signal or DC signal) | |<br>

Horizontal Controls: <br>

| Control | Description | Picture |
|-|-|-|
|Position |Moves the graph left and right | |
|Variable Time/Div |Changes the x-scale (seconds per division) | |<br>
