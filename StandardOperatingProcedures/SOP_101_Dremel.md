| Step | Procedure | Picture |
|-|-|-|
|1. | Place the multimeter leads in these ports| <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/main/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/Multimeter/Multimeter_SOP_Continuity_1.jpg" width="200"/> |
| 2. | Set the multimeter to continuity mode | <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/main/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/Multimeter//Multimeter_SOP_Continuity_2.jpg" width="200"/> |
| 3.| Place one lead on each end of the component | <img src="https://github.com/MrWillbanks/ElectronicsTechnology/blob/main/StandardOperatingProcedures/Photos/Multimeter//Multimeter_SOP_%20Continuity_3.jpg" width="200"/> |
| 4. | If the multimeter beeps at you, it is conductive. If it does not beep then it is not continuous. |
