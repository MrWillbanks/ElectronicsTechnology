PURPOSE: 
Soldering is a process used to join two or more metal components by melting and flowing a filler metal (solder) into the joint. 

PRIMARY SOLDERING PURPOSES:
ELECTRICAL CONNECTION: Soldering is commonly used in electronics to create electrical connections between components on circuit boards or to attach wire to connectors. 

MECHANICAL STRENGTH: The solder creates a strong bond between the joined components. Upon cooling, it forms a durable connection that withstands mechanical stress. Soldering is like welding for smaller items, it makes metal parts stick together so they don't break easily, even when they get moved around or face different conditions. 

HEAT CONDUCTION: Solder is a good conductor of heat, soldered joined can efficiently transfer heat away from electronic components. Maintaining the temperature balance can prevent overheating in electronic components. 

PROTECTION AGAINST WATER AND DUST: Solder creates a "seal" between joined components, protecting them from any environmental factors like moisture, dust, and other contaminants. 

SPACE EFFICIENCY: Soldered connections are more compact than other methods like mechanical connectors, or split bolt connectors. Soldering makes it suitable for limited space, such as small electronic devices. 

MATERIALS: 
SOLDERING IRON: The iron is the primary tool used for heating the solder. Soldering irons come in different types of wattages. Some irons have adjustable temperatures.

SOLDER WIRE: Solder is a metal alloy that has a low melting point that becomes liquid when heated. Solder is used to bond metal together.

SPONGE OR BRASS CLEANER: Sponge or brass is used for cleaning the soldering iron tip to remove any excess solder and oxidation, this ensures better heat transformation. 

DESOLDERING PUMP: The desoldering pump or solder sucker is used to remove molten solder from a joint. To have it work effectively, you should heat the solder joint with the iron until the solder is melted. Then, position the tip of the solder sucker close to the joint and press the button for the vacuum to activate. 

SAFETY EQUIPMENT: Highly recommend safety glasses to protect your eyes, in some cases if your iron is very hot the solder could boil up and shoot up directly into your face. 

VENTILATION: There should be ventilation when working with solder as solder contains lead. The fumes are not healthy to inhale as they are harmful. You can use a fume extractor or a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling harmful fumes when using lead solder.

STEP PROCEDURE: 
1) GATHER MATERIALS: Soldering iron, soldering wire, sponge or brass tip cleaner, desoldering pump (solder sucker), safety glasses, ventilation (if possible)

2) SAFETY PRECAUTIONS: Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes, ensure ventilation, and make sure the area you are going to work in doesn't have anything that could catch on fire.

3) WET SPONGE: If you are using a sponge instead of brass, wet the sponge using water. 

4) TURN ON THE SOLDERING IRON: Plug in the soldering iron allowing it to heat up. Wait until the iron is heated up to its appropriate temperature. You can check if the iron is ready by placing the tip on the wet sponge. 

5) HEAT THE JOINT: Hold the soldering iron at a comfortable angle (45 degrees) and touch the joint you want to solder. 

6) APPLY SOLDER: feed a small amount of solder onto the joint while applying heat until it is adequately covered. You do not need a lot of solder. The solder should form a shiny, smooth cone around the joint.

7) REMOVE SOLDERING IRON: Once the joint is soldered to your satisfaction, remove the soldering iron from the joint. Allow the solder to cool and solidify naturally. The process of solder cooling down and solidifying is very quick but once it has solidified it is still hot so do not touch the joint the second it hardens up. 

8) CLEAN AND INSPECT: After soldering a joint, clean the soldering iron tip on the wet sponge or brass tip cleaner.
When inspecting a solder joint: 
-Ensure the solder is shiny and forms a smooth, concave shape.
-Check for any bridges (unintended connection by excessive solder) 
-Verify that the solder holds both components

9) REPEAT AS NECESSARY: If you have multiple joints to solder, repeat the process for each one. Take your time to ensure the quality of each solder joint. Going fast may cause mistakes or soldering components where they aren't supposed to go. 

10) DESOLDERING: If you need to desolder or remove excess solder, use the desoldering pump (solder sucker). heat the unwanted solder place the pump above the unwanted solder and press the button that activates the pump. The vacuum should suck up the molten solder. (It may take multiple tries to get all the unwanted solder). 

11) POWER OFF: After completing the soldering work, turn off the soldering iron or unplug it if your iron doesn't have any buttons. Let the iron cool down before storing it away. 

By following these steps, you can achieve well-made and reliable solder joints. You may not get it the first time but practice makes perfect. Practice on scrap circuits before working on actual projects to improve your soldering skills.
