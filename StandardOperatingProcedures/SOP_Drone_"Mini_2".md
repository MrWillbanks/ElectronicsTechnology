1. Charge the drone and controller. For the drone I charged it from the computer, as I didn't have a block to charge it with. It takes close to an hour and a half to charge it fully from 0%-100%. The controller maintains it's battery for longer periods, however if you need to charge it, use the same method as the drone. The controller takes close to 3 hours to charge from 0%.
2. Controller set up. After charging the remote, install the joysticks into the controller. the weight is most comparable to a poloroid camera. To see the battery percentage on the controller, tap the power button. to turn on the controller, hold in the power button. the same applies for the drone. for connecting the camera from your phone to the drone, there's 2 different cords for both android and apple; choose the appropriate one.
