Changed “Wear ppe such as safety glasses.” to “Wear safety glasses.” Changed “Optionally you can wear gloves.” to “Optional: gloves.” Changed ““Acid bin”. “ to  “Acid mixing station.” Changed “2 separate glass containers.” to “Measuring cup.” Changed “Scale” to “5kg scale.”Changed “Acid powder” to “Ammonium Persulfate.” Deleted step 3. Added step “you have now made 5 cups of acid” added “with stirrer”	 |
|M.R         |  C  | 2/9/2024    |Punctuation. Removed 5g from scale. Made Ammonium Persulfate own bullet. Removed word scale |

 7.	 You have now made 5 cups of acid
 	       
 8.	 Repeat steps 1-8 if more acid is needed
