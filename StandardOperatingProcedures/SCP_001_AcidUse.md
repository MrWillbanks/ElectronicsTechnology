2.	Purpose:
2.1.	Etches copper off of circuit boards, to make printed circuit boards  
  
3.	Safety:  
3.1.	Wear safety glasses  
3.2.	Optional: gloves  
  
4.	Materials 
   
●	Measuring cup  
●	Acid mixing station  
●	Acid mixer  
●	Scale  
●	Water                              
●	Ammonium Persulfate                                                            

5.	Notes:                                                                                   
●	If you are going to etch PCBs that are under 3.25 inches (82.55mm) only make 8 cups of acid.
●	If you are going to etch PCBS over 3.25 inches and under 6.5 inches use 16 cups of acid.
●	It is preferred to etch multiple PCBs at once so, you don't waste acid.

7.	Procedure:

   
| Step  	|Procedure:|  Pictures: |
|-|-|-|
|1.| 	 Measure out 5 cups of water in an empty container| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Matthew-Ruddock/archive-photo/main/pic001.jpg?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACN2AMMAOKTUMDGHM4A74GFKZOGH2MA" alt="image" width="200"/>|
|2. |	 Press the tare button on scale, scale should read 0 grams| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Matthew-Ruddock/archive-photo/main/pic002.jpg?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACN2AMMA7HNUBHBTKFHZXFC2ZOGH4IQ" alt="image" width="200"/> |
|3.|	 Measure out 500 grams (half-bottle) of the dry Ammonium Persulfate into a seperate dyr measuring container.| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Matthew-Ruddock/archive-photo/main/pic003-1.jpg" alt="image" width="200"/>  |
|4.|	 Slowly pour the measured out ammonium persulfate powder into water| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Matthew-Ruddock/archive-photo/main/pic003.jpg?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACN2AMMBL2GTN6RHTFESAHZIZOGH4WQ" alt="image" width="200"/>  |
|5.|	 Slowly mix acid powder into water using acid stirrer| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Matthew-Ruddock/archive-photo/main/pic004.jpg?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACN2AMMAYR753HAZ5CBTOHVAZOGH5BA" alt="image" width="200"/>|
|6.|	 Keep stirring until the solution is liquid with no clumps| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Matthew-Ruddock/archive-photo/main/pic005.jpg?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACN2AMMBVT56VURMUUQ6EXH4ZOGH5KA" alt="image" width="200"/>	|   
|7.|	 Pour mixed solution into the “acid bin” for later use| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Matthew-Ruddock/archive-photo/main/pic006.jpg?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACN2AMMAGJJJNE5DNBZP5WQ4ZOGH5WQ" alt="image" width="200"/> |
|8.|	 You have now made 8 cups of acid|    empty |
 	       
|9.|	 Repeat steps 1-8 if more acid is needed|   empty |
